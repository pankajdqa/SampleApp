    <string name="help">"Rules of the Game - 
The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21.

Values of the Cards - 

* An Ace can count as either 1 or 11.
* The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.
* The 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.

The value of a hand is simply the sum of the point counts of each card in the hand. For example, a hand containing (5,7,8) has the value of 20.

Ace will be counted as 1 only if you are going over 21 or there are two Aces in the hand.
For example, a hand containing (A,7) has the value of 18. A hand containing (A,7,8) has the value of 16. Here Ace is counted as 1.

Button Click - 

	Hit -  Means you want to draw another card.
	Stand -  Means you stop at the current total.
	Surrender - You will lose half money you bet in the hand.
